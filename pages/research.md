### The main focus of our research is how young children learn their first languages. 

There are three main topics that we are investigating at the moment.

-   How do children learn semantic properties of the functional lexicon?
  - Examples: definiteness, plurality, comparatives, implicatures and presuppositions.
-   How do properties of the input, particularly its variability and reliability affect the acquisition process?

### Much of our research is cross-linguistic.  Currently we are studying language acquisition in the following languages:

- English 
- Latin American Spanish (Argentinian and Paraquayan)
- Brazilian Portuguese
- Mandarin
