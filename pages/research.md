### The main focus of our research is how young children learn their first languages. There are three main topics that we are investigating at the moment.

-   How do children learn semantic properties of the functional lexicon?
    Examples: definiteness, plurality, comparatives, implicatures and presuppositions.
-   How do properties of the input, particularly its variability and reliability affect the acquisition process?
-   How do children acquire and use prosodic properties of language that interact with syntax?

#### Much of our research is cross-linguistic.  Currently we are studying language acquisition in the following languages:

-   Chilean and Mexican Spanish
-   Brazilian Portuguese
-   Mandarin Chinese
-   Japanese
-   Korean
