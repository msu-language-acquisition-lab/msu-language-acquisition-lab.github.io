The lab currently consists of the following people.

## Faculty

- Cristina Schmitt
- Alan Munn

## Current Graduate Students

- Savvy Barnes
- Xiaoke Bu
- [Louis Konkoly](https://www.msuacquisition.org/research/agreement-and-coordinate-non-DP-subjects/)
- John Ryan
    - John Ryan is a PhD student studying how children acquire tense and aspect through psycholinguistic methodologies. John is interested in exploring questions like how children navigate the acquisition of tense and aspect given their emerging and developing event representations and what the trajectory of their development can tell us about properties of Language as a whole. In particular, John’s research focuses primarily on the acquisition of the imperfective and progressive in American English and Argentine Spanish. 
    Beyond this primary focus, John has been investigating properties of “sequential ‘and’”. For example, the sentence “Mary fell and broke her arm” is fine when describing events that happened in that order (Mary first fell and then broke her arm), but reversing the conjuncts relative to the same context is comparatively odd: “#Mary broke her arm and fell”. This project ties closely to his broader interest in how events are represented and organized with respect to tense and aspect.

- [Jingying Xu](https://jingyingx.github.io/)
    - Languages have sophisticated ways of encoding the temporal structure of events, signaling different types of endings either explicitly or implicitly. This project investigates how language and context influence the interpretation of event descriptions in English and Mandarin, focusing on both children and adults. We aim to address three key questions:
    - How do linguistic elements—such as verbs, direct objects, and tense/aspect markers in English and Mandarin, two typologically distinct languages—affect the way children and adults evaluate whether events have reached their natural endpoints?
    - What is the developmental trajectory of aspectual understanding in English- and Mandarin-speaking children, and what causes the non-adultlike responses often observed in children?
    - How does visual context interact with language to shape how children and adults perceive events and interpret event descriptions?
- Ellie Xia
    - Ellie is interested in computational modelling of child language acquisition. She is also working on aspect marking in Sinitic languages.
