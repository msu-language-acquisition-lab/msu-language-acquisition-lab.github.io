Congratulations to Cristina for a successful talk at the Syntax and Variation workshop this weekend at the Summer Linguistic Institute! Her talk was titled _What can variation tell about acquisition and what can acquisition tell about variation?_, and she discussed the influence of variable input in first language acquisition, using experimental data with a focus on the comprehension of grammatical number and verbal agreement morphosyntax across Spanish and Portuguese dialects.

A big congratulations also goes to Alan, who was an organizer of this workshop-- it was a huge success! Many of our lab members came out to support the event; it was a fun and intellectually stimulating weekend with lots of syntax, variation, and acquisition!

(I think the workshop slides and handouts are going to be posted on their website soon.)

 

I hope everyone is having a great summer, and I hope those at the Summer Linguistic Institute are enjoying all of the linguistic adventures.
