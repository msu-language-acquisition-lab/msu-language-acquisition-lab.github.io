“A lot of children’s books are marketed under the guides of number of words, new words, and vocab. That's what determines their reading level,” Jaroszewicz said. “That’s not exactly meaningful linguistically, it’s not the number of words that make a book linguistically complex, there’s lots of different things, like the use of pronouns, which always requires the hearer to work a bit more because they have to find the referent for it in the discourse. The same is true for other aspects of the linguistic system.”
